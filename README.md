> **"Protect your time. Track abuse. Take control."**

**Freelance Armor** is a professional-grade defensive system designed for architects, designers, and creative consultants. It focuses on documenting client interactions, quantifying "wasteful" time, and maintaining firm professional boundaries through AI-assisted communication.

Born from the reality of client abuse in the architectural industry, this tool empowers freelancers to regain control of their work-life balance.
